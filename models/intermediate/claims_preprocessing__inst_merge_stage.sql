-- Author       Thu Xuan Vu
-- Created      June 2022
-- Purpose      Compare institutional claims chronogically to evaluate relationship.  Only continuous 
--                stay encounter types are evaulated for merging.
-- Notes        Claims for a patient are merged if:
--                - dates overlap and the facility is the same
--                - date is off by no more than 1 day, facility is the same, and previous claim has a 
--                  discharge status of 30 - still a patient
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Modification History
-- 09/27/2022 Thu Xuan Vu
--      Removed an excess case statement from the strict overlap logic. 
--        previous_claim_start_date >= claim_start_date listed twice
--      Changed references of merge_claim_id to claim_id
